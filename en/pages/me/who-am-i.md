# Who am I? <Badge type="tip" text="WIP" />

Hello it's me Amin! 👋🏽

I'm a passionate 26-years-old web developer based in Grenoble, France. I love challenges and building ambitious applications from scratch. 

In my free time you'll find me playing videos-games, listening some music, painting minis or tinkering some stuff 🔧
